Cancer Detection using Streamlit
This is a simple cancer detection app built using Streamlit. It uses a machine learning model to predict whether a given medical image (either grayscale or RGB) contains signs of cancer.

Installation
To run the app locally, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.6+
Streamlit
PyTorch
Numpy
Matplotlib

You can install all of these dependencies using pip. For example:
pip install streamlit torch numpy matplotlib

Usage
To start the app, run the following command in your search box:
https://sravan1023-cancer-detection-app-h17iqk.streamlit.app/

This will launch the app. From there, you can select an image to upload and the model will make a prediction based on the image.

Model Details
The machine learning model used in this app is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on a large dataset of medical images. The model has achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting signs of cancer in these images.
